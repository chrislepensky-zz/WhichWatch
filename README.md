# WhichWatch

# Overview
The premise of this project is to allow a user to upload an image of a wristwatch and have it classified into either a dress watch capable of being worn to a formal event, or a casual watch. The app utilizes a classified image data set to train a machine learning model for the prediction of classification of new watch images. Classification allows the clustering of similar watches and recommendations of highly similar watches to the user.

# How it works
I trained various machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network) of a data set of watch images (about 1300) scraped from a watch retailers site along with all the metadata associatied.
