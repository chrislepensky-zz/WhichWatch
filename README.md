# WhichWatch

# Overview
The premise of this project is to allow a user to upload an image of a wristwatch and have it classified into either a dress watch capable of being worn to a formal event, or a casual watch. The app utilizes a classified image data set to train a ML model for the prediction of new watch images. Classification allows the clustering of similar watches and recommendations of highly similar watches to the user.
